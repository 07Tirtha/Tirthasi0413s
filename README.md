- 👋 Hi, I’m @TirthaPM.
- 👀 I’m interested in working in any small and big projects. Many of them are mobile and pc games and apps. I also like to work in web developing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and html for web developing, because recently, I have completed the course of python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anybody's problems. Especially if it is in python, javascript or html. 
- 📫 You can reach me at 07tirtha@gmail.com.
